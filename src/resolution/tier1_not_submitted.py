Tier 1 - NOT SUBMITTED Classification.

ONLY for fields explicitly marked as not for regulatory submission:
- RSG (Remote Site Gateway) internal fields
- Calculation/derived fields created for system purposes
- Fields with explicit "do not submit" markers
- CRF workflow-only instructions that slip through the parser filter

This does NOT catch dictionary-derived fields (MedDRA, ATC, etc.)
-- those have real SDTM variable mappings and are handled by Tier 0.

# Every entry in that file is a dictionary-derived/coded field (MedDRA PT/LLT/SOC,
# WHO-Drug preferred name, ATC class, dictionary version, ...) that DOES have a
# real SDTM destination per SDTM-MSG v2.0 — the coded variables (--DECOD, --BODSYS,
# --LLT, ...) are submitted with Origin = Assigned, and version fields go to the
# SUPP-- qualifiers (MEDDRAV / WHODRGV). Marking them "[NOT SUBMITTED]" was
# incorrect. They are now mapped to their actual variables by Tier 0
# (_resolve_dictionary_field). Tier 1 here only catches fields that are genuinely
# not for submission (RSG/internal/derived-for-calculation markers) via the
